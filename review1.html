        i am giving this review because of i forced by the moto 2 to do it .Its a gorgeous looking ,very good build quality phone.within in 36 hours walmart delivered it . My friend have ASUS Zen Phone 5 and i compared all aspects and my reaction is just amazing because in many aspects it beat the Asus like in Camera quality.

        User Comments : I brought my first Android phone after my iphone in walmart site, so im still exploring the device. Coming to the delivery, walmart does a very decent job they delivered the phone on the next day. 
Camera: Does a decent job in indoor and outdoor. 
Voice quality is very good. But i'm worried about only the signal catching. my Samsung and iphone is showing up good signal strength.
